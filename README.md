In this project,
I developed and deployed a simple "Hello, World!"
Go web application using Docker and Kubernetes. I
containerized the application using Docker, then used
Kubernetes (via Minikube) to orchestrate the deployment. I
created Kubernetes resources, including deployments and
services, and ensured the application was accessible via
NodePort. This project demonstrates my skills in
containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and troubleshooting
Kubernetes deployments.
